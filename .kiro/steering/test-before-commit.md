## Test before Task summary
You should run all the tests before starting any task, and ensure they are all passing (no warnings as well)

At the end of all tasks, you should run all the tests again to ensure that the code is still passing.

Then you can generate a TASK_<task_number>_summary.md file, and add it to the task summary section of the README.md file.
