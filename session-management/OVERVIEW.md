# Session Management & WebSocket Infrastructure - Overview

## What This Component Does

This component provides the foundation for real-time multilingual audio broadcasting by managing:

1. **Speaker Sessions**: Authenticated speakers create broadcasting sessions with memorable IDs
2. **HTTP Session API**: RESTful API for session CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
3. **Listener Connections**: Anonymous listeners join sessions to receive translated audio
4. **WebSocket Management**: Persistent bidirectional communication via AWS API Gateway
5. **Connection Lifecycle**: Handles connect, heartbeat, disconnect, and refresh events
6. **State Management**: Tracks sessions and connections in DynamoDB
7. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through configurable limits
8. **Long Sessions**: Supports unlimited duration through connection refresh

## Current Status

### ✅ Deployed to Dev Environment
- **HTTP API Endpoint**: https://a4zdtiok36.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
- **WebSocket API Endpoint**: wss://kudr9na6xh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
- **Environment**: dev
- **Last Deployment**: Task 18 (HTTP API deployment)
- **All Tests**: Passing

### Recent Milestones
- ✅ HTTP + WebSocket Hybrid Architecture (Tasks 1-17)
- ✅ HTTP API Deployed to Dev (Task 18)
- 🔄 CloudWatch Monitoring (Task 19 - Next)
- ⏳ Staging Deployment (Task 20 - Pending)

## Key Features

### Human-Readable Session IDs
- Format: `{adjective}-{noun}-{3-digit-number}`
- Example: `golden-eagle-427`
- Christian/Bible-themed vocabulary
- Easy to share verbally

### Scalability
- Serverless architecture (Lambda + DynamoDB)
- On-demand capacity
- Up to 500 listeners per session
- Automatic cleanup via TTL

### Resilience
- Connection refresh for sessions > 2 hours
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Idempotent operations

### Security
- JWT authentication for speakers
- TLS 1.2+ encryption (WSS)
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention
- No sensitive data logging

## Architecture at a Glance

### HTTP + WebSocket Hybrid Architecture

```
Speaker (Authenticated)
    ↓ HTTPS + JWT (Session CRUD)
HTTP API Gateway → Session Handler Lambda
    ↓
DynamoDB (Sessions, Connections)
    ↑
    ↓ WSS + JWT (Audio Streaming)
WebSocket API Gateway
    ↓
Lambda Authorizer → Cognito
    ↓
Connection Handler
    ↓
Listeners (Anonymous)
```

**Key Design:**
- **HTTP API**: Stateless session management (create, read, update, delete)
- **WebSocket API**: Stateful real-time audio streaming
- **Separation of Concerns**: Session lifecycle independent of WebSocket connections

## Technology Stack

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute (Python 3.11)
- **AWS API Gateway**: WebSocket API management
- **AWS DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for state
- **AWS Cognito**: User authentication (JWT)
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code (Python)
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
